# Book Inventory

A simple Clojure-based book inventory management system. This project allows you to add, update, delete, and list books in your inventory. It's built with Clojure and uses an in-memory data store to manage the books.

## Features

- View all books in the inventory.
- Add a new book to the inventory.
- Update book details (title, author, year, genre).
- Delete a book from the inventory by ID.

## Getting Started

To run the project, you'll need to have [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/) installed on your machine. Leiningen is a build automation tool for Clojure.
